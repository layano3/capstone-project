# MathQuest Escape: Interactive Virtual Learning Environment

## Project Overview

MathQuest Escape is an immersive educational platform that transforms mathematical problem-solving into interactive virtual escape room experiences. Designed to integrate with an existing educational gaming ecosystem, this project focuses on creating engaging, avatar-based escape room scenarios where students apply mathematical concepts to progress through challenges.

### Key Features
- Interactive virtual environments where student avatars can explore and solve puzzles
- Mathematics-based challenge system incorporating existing reward mechanics (XP, Power Crystals, Hearts, and Gold Coins)
- Real-time avatar interaction with environmental objects (levers, doors, collectibles)
- Integration capabilities with the main MathQuest platform for seamless student progression tracking
- Customizable puzzle difficulty levels to accommodate different learning stages

This module will serve as a complementary component to the existing MathQuest educational platform, providing an immersive dimension to the mathematical learning experience while maintaining consistency with the established gameplay mechanics and reward systems.
